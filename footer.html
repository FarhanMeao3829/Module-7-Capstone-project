      <h1>El Classico</h1>
      <p>
        While "El Clásico" refers to the Spanish football match between Real
        Madrid and FC Barcelona, there's no official "El Clásico Bangladesh
        branch" or direct LaLiga branch in Bangladesh. However, there's an El
        Clásico Sports Hub Facebook page that seems to be promoting sports
        facilities. Additionally, LaLiga has held viewing parties for El Clásico
        in Bangladesh. The Dhaka Derby, between Abahani and Mohammadan, is
        sometimes referred to as the "Bangladeshi El Clásico" due to their
        historical rivalry.

      <p>
        On 11 July 1968, Barcelona beat Real Madrid 1–0 in the Copa del
        Generalísimo final at the Santiago Bernabéu. Real Madrid fans, angry
        about the refereeing, started throwing bottles at the referee and
        Barcelona players in the last minutes of the match.[49] Antonio Rigo,
        the referee of the final, was accused of favouring Barcelona.[49]
        Regarding the two not awarded penalties, he said "I didn't see a penalty
        on Amancio, and Serena tripped. He wanted to deceive me by diving when
        he entered the penalty area." He also accused the Real Madrid manager of
        trying to bribe him with a pre-match gift.[49] General Franco presented
        the trophy to Barcelona with a pitch full of bottles, hence the
        name.[50][51]
