          The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat or house
          cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only
          domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology
          and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in
          the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and farm
          cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It
          is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin.
          Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey species such
          as mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and
          sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well
          developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a
          crepuscular predator.

          Cat intelligence is evident in their ability to adapt, learn through
          observation, solve problems and research has shown they possess strong
          memories, exhibit neuroplasticity, and display cognitive skills
          comparable to a young child. Cat communication includes meowing,
          purring, trilling, hissing, growling, grunting, and body language. It
          can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears,
          such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives
          pheromones.
